A responsive website is key to providing a positive experience to these users on tablet and mobile. 

The layout adapts to the screen size on any device (even future ones), is easier to maintain over a separate mobile site and is the preferred method for search as recommended by Google.

I can implement responsive layouts using your existing content management system.
