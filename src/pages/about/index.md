**I'm a British freelance web developer based in the heart of London's tech hub, Shoreditch.**

Over the last 10 years I've developed websites and web applications for a range of clients from startups to multi-national corporations all over the world.

Prior to freelancing, I worked at <a href="https://bluestatedigital.com" target="_blank">Blue State Digital</a> in London & New York building [web projects](/projects/) for governments, political campaigns, and corporations.
